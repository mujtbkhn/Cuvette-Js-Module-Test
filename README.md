ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME

Watch the Live Link - [here](https://cuvette-js-module-test-mujtaba.vercel.app/)

this project was provided by Cuvette as the Js Module test for testing our learnings of Javascript, it was fun yet challenging lying in the perfect spot 

The Key Learning I Got from it:
 1. Documenting everything so anyone who reads the code can understand everything
 2. Planning the project
 3. Researching 

Overall this was a very good beginner friendly Javascript project, i would like to thank the Cuvette team for providing us this opportunity and looking forward to the upcoming challenges
